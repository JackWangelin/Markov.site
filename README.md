##Markov Chains
A Markov chain describes the probability of states transition, the progression between states, & the given set of conditions that provides cause for probability. For more information & examples, visit the [Markov Chain Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_Markov_chains "Markov Chain Wikipedia Page").

##The Site's Purpose
This is an attempt to create an intrinsically bad user experience. I am attemptitng to remove my (the site's creator's) ability to define a goal for the visitor.
The intent is to set up a series of conditions: to create probabilty states rendered using good, bad or neutral UX heuristics. The resultant action is a button click. Irreversible progress is enforced by ReCaptcha. To follow the button link, the user must enter a unique captcha: once completed, hitting 'refresh' or 'back,'while providing the same, or just visited page, is still progress in the chain model, as intrinsically, the captcha can't be undone. 
With no predefined goal, but assurance that the user is always taking the next step, allows a negative user emotional response without a purpose. Removing the purpose, removes the option for a UX design to achieve goal, without a goal, a UX design cannot be judged as well designed or poorly designed.
Enabling a user to experience negative emotions with no defined purpose, except whatever the user defines their own goal to be, achieves what I would name a Bad User Experience.

##Site Design
- 3 buttons
- 3 pages
- 3 sets of heuristics
- .js is used to randomize the button links on one page.
- Bootstrap is used to style.

##Next Steps
- Adding in ReCaptcha
- Improving the randomization capacity
- Experimenting with a small value payment instead of ReCaptcha - debating whether or not this adds a goal from the creator side: plausibly my want to give concrete value to progression on the user side creates a goal of improving time spent on site.
- Working out better page UX design for good & bad pages
- Does having a UXD per page affect the overall goal? Or does it just create a certain condition only on the page?
